# Sudoku
Sudoku GUI program built with Tkinter - generates, grades, and solves Sudoku boards.

## Installation
Clone this repository to get all required files. Double click sudokuGUI.py directly from the file explorer to run this program.

## How to Play
Generate an Easy, Medium, or Hard board to play - or clear the board and enter your own sudoku puzzle to solve and/or play.

Get a visual cue of your progress using 'Grade Board' - a flash or red means the board (with all current entries) is unsolvable.
Yellow means it is solvable, but not yet solved. Green indicates a fully solved board.

Solve the board to instantly fill in the solution.
